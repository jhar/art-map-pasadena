# Art Map Pasadena

Utilizes Google Maps, Facebook Graph API, and Knockout.js to create a local map of events at selected arts organizations.

A simple node server is included for deploying to services like Heroku.

## To do:
* User should be able to interact with events (joining, etc)
* The UI and visual effects could always be improved
* The search function could also work through event titles and descriptions
* Make it more general - working for any given location
