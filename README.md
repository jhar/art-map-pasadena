# Art Map Pasadena

Utilizes Google Maps, Facebook Graph API, and Knockout.js to create a local map of events at selected arts organizations.

A simple node server is included for deploying to services like Heroku.

The app's functionality is there, but it might not appear to be so because I'm in the middle of revising the UI.

## To do:
* User should be able to interact with events (joining, etc)
* The UI and visual effects could always be improved
* The search function could also work through event titles and descriptions
* Make it more general - working for any given location
